Design changes and rationale
	[ ] SRS (Jedidiah + James)
		[ ] Process updated
		[ ] Last two paragraphs in the "Competition" section seem to belong in another heading
		[ ] Use cases
			[ ] Barter/haggle (Transactions - Change the name)
				[ ] Needs to be fleshed out in more detailed
				[ ] Needs to have two actions for this to make sense. How will they interact?
					How do they signal to system that they reached an agreement? etc
			[ ] What is "prodcut refunds lender"? Assuming that you are
				referring to SharingBooks as the product and the paying user as the
				lender, this means that the user has given SB their money in the past
					There's no such transaction in use case
	[ ] SDS (Wei-Ting)
		[ ] Updated descriptions
		[ ] Class diagrams
		[ ] Updated Team Structure
		[ ] Architecture
			[ ] Alternative designs
			[ ] Why chose your design in preference to them
			[ ] Assumptions behind design
			[ ] Don't repeat yourself
			[ ] The sequence diagram for trading a book is misleading because at first it looks like only 
				one user is involved. Also, your design involves a sequence of synchronous calls, 
				but you can't implement that in a web application. The book owner might not be logged on 
				when a user requests a loan -- how will you store this state? 
			[ ] Also, how will you push these notifications to your users?
		[ ] Process
			[ ] Don't redefine standard terms like MVC or integration test
			[ ] "sample" timeline? What's that?
			[ ] Testing complete date is separate from feature completion date?
				But you said you'll test features in parallel?
			[ ] User validation
			[ ] Paragraph before "System Test" heading contains no new info, delete
			[ ] What does hassle-free mean for communication between program modules
			[ ] How will we involve our customer team, and how we plan to acquire more outside users
			[ ] adequacy and bug-tracking sections are content-free
		[ ] Risks
			[ ] Need to order risk by importance
			[ ] How do we minimize the number of different places where we directly depend on API
				Build wrappers that we can change if needed?
			[ ] Integration risk is unneeded - Use AWS going down
			[ ] Give more details about "additional usability testing" that will mitigate risk that our product won't get users
				How will we get feed back and how we'll react to it
			[ ] Concerns and mitigations in speed/scalability risk section is inconsistent
				If CakePHP is the problem, keeping DB requests small won't solve it
				Horizontal Scaling?
	[ ] ZFR (Wei-Ting + Greg)
		[ ] User Documentation
			[ ] Make sure features that are working are documented
		[ ] Developer Documentation
			[ ] Use a tag for release version
			[X] Don't ask the developer to edit line 290 of http.conf, patch it (Greg)
			[X] Run MySQL command-line tool with the DB setup in your script instead of asking developer to set permissions manually (Greg)
			[X] Make sure Step 2 of Joel test is followed (Greg)
			[-] Build and test
				[X] Cake is not in path (Greg)
				[ ] Automated daily build (Wei-Ting)
			[ ] Release
				[ ] hg update -r Version -0.0 doesn't work
				[ ] document DB schema will never change
					[ ] Or say how developer is supposed to migrate data from old version to new one
					
			[ ] Updated Steps
			[ ] List two design pattern or principle discussed in class
				[ ] MVC
				[ ] Interning Books
